                            <p>
                                These two animal parks are legendary! Tsavo East and Tsavo West are some of the oldest
                                and definitely the largest combined parks in Kenya. Here you will find Africa’s Big
                                Five, a special rhino sanctuary and beautiful watering spots where great herds of
                                elephants gather.
                                This is the home of the famous Tsavo lions, over 600 species of birds and surprises like
                                monkeys, hippos and crocodiles.
                                The landforms here are immense – great swaths of golden savannah, dark stretches of
                                volcanic lava beds and bright, crystalline springs.
                                We’ll set up your journey for any special requests. So, get ready for your private road
                                and rail adventure through the heart of Tsavo!
